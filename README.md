# TorrentFinder

A chrome extension to shorten your search for torrents


    **WORK IN PROGRESS NOTICE:**

    This project is an early stage of development (though it's already a working prototype) and thus code may be in less then optimal state when examined.

*TODO list:*

[ ] Refactor search engines code to be more generic = easier adding new engines
[ ] Make dynamically created div draggable + close button
[ ] Add a nicer icon
[ ] Add the ability to add custom engines (in options)
[ ] Add setting to fetch other number of results (1, 3, 5, 10, custom)
[ ] Add the ability to paginate the results + sort

## Instructions

1. Install crx
2. Browse any website (http/s)
3. Right click your target search query
4. Search for torrent links
